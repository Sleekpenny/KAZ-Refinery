        A total of 193 new production wells were commissioned, including 109
        horizontal wells. Average daily flow at new wells was 37.8 tonnes,
        including 65.5 tonnes from horizontal wells. Total production from new
        wells (Group share) was 5.47 million tonnes. Drilling of horizontal
        wells has been found to be highly efficient and the Company plans to
        increase their numbers in the medium term. We lead the development of
        Kaz Refinery Oil's strategy, to drive the long-term resilience and value
        of our business and create value for our stakeholders more widely,
        including society, our employees and our shareholders. Processing
        products is for us one of the most budget-oriented activities.
